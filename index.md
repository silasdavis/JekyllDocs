## Introduction

The Operon Cloud provides a secure open platform that enables you to build interoperable apps for health and social care.

Our platform provides the plumbing and takes care of much of the "heavy lifting" allowing you to concentrate your efforts on application functionality while the platform deals with issues including interoperability, cyber-security, information governance and business continuity.

Unlike many other platforms which are based on proprietary approaches which mean your application is locked-in to the platform the Operon Cloud uses established open standards including openEHR, IHE-XDS, FHIR and SMART which means you applications are easily transportable to other platforms based on these standards.

## Build a Operino

The building blocks of the Operon Cloud are called Operinos. An Operion provides a container for a set of services from the Operon Cloud that you need for a particular application To use the Operon Cloud you need at least one Operino, although you can create as many as you need.

## Explore the API

All interaction with the Operon Cloud is through a set of REST APIs that are provisioned for you when you create an Operino. The easiest way to understand how these APIs work and the services they provide is to read the documentation and explore the APIs using Postman which provides a test harness allowing you to experiment with the APIs available in your Operinos.
