## What is the EHR Explorer?
The EHR Explorer provides an administrative interface into the openEHR Clinical Data Repository, enabling administrators and developers to upload clinical artefacts, to build, test and save simple forms against these templates and build, run and save queries into the data.

## How can I access it?
When you created your Operon account and provisioned your first Operino, you received an email with your domain and login details. If you are accessing a domain on behalf of someone else, you will need to get the credentials from them.
