The Operon Ehrscape API consumes, retrieves and queries patient healthcare data using a standardised specification and querying format defined by the openEHR Foundation. openEHR is complex and can be difficult for novices to understand (even those with a solid technical background) but the Ehrscape API considerably simplifies the interface with openEHR systems.

[openEHR](http://openehr.org) provides a way for clinicians to define and share open-source, vendor-neutral clinical information components ('archetypes' and 'templates') which can be consumed, persisted and queried by different technology stacks, as long as they adhere to the openEHR specifications. Examples of archetypes used in this project are `'Procedure', 'Symptom', and 'Imaging result'`. These are managed by the openEHR Foundation using the [Clinical Knowledge Manager](http://openehr.org/ckm) tool and mirrored to [Github](https://github.com/openEHR/CKM-mirror), with a CC-BY-SA licence.

A repository of archetypes and templates designed for UK use is maintained jointly by NHS Scotland, Apperta Foundation and RippleOSI at clinicalmodels.org.uk and and mirrored to a [Git repository](https://github.com/ClinicalModelsUK/ckm). HSCIC also have an openEHR CKM repository at http://ckm.hscic.gov.uk/ckm/.
